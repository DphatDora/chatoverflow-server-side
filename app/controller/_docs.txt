Again, ya'll know what is this, ob vi ous ly....

We all know that we have two ways to structure this one, 
1. Write some huge controller and wrap all the related login into it:
    ├── App.controller.js
    ├── User.controller.js
2. Sepreate them as in our project

I choose the 2rh ways because it make our workflow seprately, so you don't want another guys to modify your work-on controller.
