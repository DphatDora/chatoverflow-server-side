Auth routes like login, signup... are breaked into separate files, which eventually combined by index.js

So:
auth/login -> point to login
auth/signup -> point to signup

`app.js` use `auth/index.js` as `/auth` so we finnaly have `www..../auth/login`


-------These auth route is POST JUST FOR EZ TO TESTING, PLEASE CHANGE THE METHOD LATER.-----
-------Ohter route include feed, use... just for demo-----
